# Delinquency_Prediction_Data_Analysus_Project
Customer delinquency analysis using Python with data preprocessing, missing value handling, and exploratory data analysis to identify financial and behavioral factors influencing loan default risk

# Delinquency Prediction and Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer financial and behavioral data to understand the factors associated with loan delinquency. The goal is to identify patterns that differentiate delinquent and non-delinquent customers using data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Dataset Features
The dataset includes important financial and behavioral attributes such as:
- Customer_ID
- Income
- Loan_Balance
- Credit_Score
- Credit_Utilization
- Debt_to_Income_Ratio
- Employment_Status
- Missed_Payments
- Delinquent_Account (Target Variable)

## Project Workflow
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Handling Missing Values
   - Income → Mean Imputation
   - Loan Balance → Median Imputation
   - Credit Score → Median Imputation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Delinquency distribution
   - Income vs Delinquency
   - Credit score analysis
   - Debt-to-income ratio analysis
   - Employment status analysis
   - Behavioral risk analysis (Missed Payments)
4. Correlation Analysis using Heatmaps

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

## Key Insights
The analysis reveals relationships between missed payments, credit utilization, income levels, and delinquency risk, helping in understanding customer default behavior.
- Higher missed payments strongly correlate with delinquency.
- Customers with lower credit scores show higher default risk.
- Debt-to-income ratio impacts repayment behavior.
